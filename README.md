# Recursive_Java_Decompiler
Recursive Bash Program to Decompile a JAR/WAR and all of its nested libraries

Usage:
1.  Edit execute.sh and point it to whatever JAR or WAR filepath
2.  Run "sh execute.sh" and let it finish
3.  Enjoy your indexable source code for searching

Side Note:
- This can be easily modified to support any programming language, just swap out the file extensions and decompiler
